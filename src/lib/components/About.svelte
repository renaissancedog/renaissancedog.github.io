        Hello! I’m William, a rising high school junior who loves to learn about
        our world. I'm especially interested in math - my favorite subjects
        being algebra and combinatorics - and I also like to create things, both
        physically and digitally, to bring ideas to life.
        <br /> <br />
        Outside of school, you’ll probably find me practicing my violin, training
        for a triathlon, reading, watching YouTube (3BlueBrown, Jay Foreman, Wendover,
        and Jet Lag are my favorite channels), or spending time in nature. I'm always
        looking for new ways to learn, create, and grow.
