        Hello! I’m William, a high school junior who loves to learn about our
        world. I'm especially interested in math - my favorite subjects being
        algebra and combinatorics - and I also like to create things, both
        physically and digitally, to bring ideas to life.
        <br /> <br />
        Outside of school, you’ll probably find me practicing my violin, exercising,
        reading, watching YouTube (3BlueBrown, Jay Foreman, Wendover, and Jet Lag
        are my favorite channels), or spending time in nature.
