        Hello! I’m William, a high school sophomore with a huge passion for
        STEM. Whether it’s coding, building cool electronics, or diving into
        fascinating branches of math, I love figuring out how things work.
        <br />
        I also enjoy competing in STEM competitions and connecting with others who
        share my curiosity. When I’m not busy with school, you’ll probably find me
        exercising, practicing my violin, creating something new, or dreaming up
        my next big idea.
