        Hello! I’m William, a high school junior who loves to learn about our
        world.
        <br /> <br />
        I'm extremely interested in all types of mathematics. Beyond the typical high-school
        curriculum, I enjoy studying all sorts of advanced math, such as analysis,
        linear algebra, combinatorics, number theory, and probability. I am currently
        preparing to help write a research paper (on scissors congruence in higher
        dimensions) as part of Texas A&M's PReMa program. I have also qualified for
        the AIME three times and won awards competing in various math competitions
        (such as the AMC series, the Stanford Math Tournament, and UIL.)
        <br /> <br />
        I like to create all types of things, both physically and digitally, to bring
        ideas to life. I have built several projects with microcontrollers for my
        own use, and I'm very proud of my new, custom-built alarm clock. I like to
        code, and I have created various projects to make life easier for myself.
        I'm currently learning about data structures and algorithms to help myself
        make larger, more impactful projects. I also compete in the silver division
        of the USACO programming contests.
        <br /> <br />
        I believe that knowledge is best used when shared, so I enjoy helping others
        learn. I have tutored peers in all sorts of STEM fields, and in my positions
        at school (as an officer of the math team and the math honor society), I work
        to promote and foster an appreciation of math, as well as of learning in general.
        <br /> <br />
        Outside of my adventures in STEM, you’ll probably find me practicing my violin,
        exercising (I'm running a half-marathon soon!), reading, watching YouTube
        (3BlueBrown, Vsauce, Wendover, and Jet Lag are my favorite channels), or spending
        time in nature. In the future, I hope to study something STEM-related in college,
        and eventually become a scientist or engineer to create the ideas that make
        our world a better place.
